# OPTIONAL. Most customers already have a security or logging project — point
# 02-audit-logs-organization at it and skip this entirely. Run this for greenfield, or when
# the only candidate is a WORKLOAD project, which is the wrong answer: Pub/Sub
# publish quota is consumed in the destination project, and a security pipeline
# inside a workload project can be read or broken by that workload's owner.
