# SINGLE-PROJECT PILOT.
#
# THIS DOES NOT COVER FUTURE PROJECTS. A project sink has no include_children
# because nothing exists below a project. It is the cheapest way to prove the
# whole pipeline end to end before asking for organization-scope IAM — which is
# usually the real blocker — and it should be REPLACED by 02-audit-logs-organization, not
# repeated per project.
#
# acknowledge_pilot_scope is set here deliberately: choosing this directory IS
# the acknowledgement.
