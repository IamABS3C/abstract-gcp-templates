# Cloud Asset Inventory — resource and IAM-policy CHANGES, org-wide.
#
# The third thing a log sink cannot carry. CAI has its own feed straight to
# Pub/Sub: not a sink, not a filter, and no widening of log_categories reaches it.
#
# Worth deploying alongside 02-audit-logs-organization rather than instead of it. They
# answer different questions:
#
#   admin_activity  who called which API
#   CAI IAM_POLICY  what the policy now IS, and what it was before
#
# Three different API paths to the same binding produce three audit entries and
# ONE identical policy diff. The diff is what a detection wants.
