# Logs ALREADY sitting in a Cloud Storage bucket.
#
# For vendor exports, third-party appliances, or an existing pipeline that
# writes objects. Different mechanism from the Log Router entirely:
#
#   bucket → OBJECT_FINALIZE notification → Pub/Sub → Abstract fetches the object
#
# If the logs are Google's own, use 02-audit-logs-organization instead. An aggregated sink
# is strictly better than watching buckets.
