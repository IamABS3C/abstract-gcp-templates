# Security Command Center findings.
#
# SCC does NOT flow through the Log Router. It publishes to Pub/Sub through its
# own NotificationConfig — not a sink, not a filter. No log_categories entry and
# no widened filter will ever collect it, which is why this is its own
# deployment rather than a flag on the log export.
#
# Its own topic and subscription on purpose: findings are a different shape from
# audit logs, arrive at a different rate, and you may want different retention.
