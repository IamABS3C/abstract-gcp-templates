# Export GCP billing account audit logs to Abstract Security

<walkthrough-tutorial-duration duration="15"></walkthrough-tutorial-duration>

This sets up a **dedicated Cloud Logging sink on your GCP Cloud Billing Account**.

**GCP Billing Account audit logs sit outside the resource hierarchy entirely.** Organization, folder, and project sinks do **NOT** capture them. If you only deploy an organization sink, you will completely miss billing IAM changes, project billing associations, and budget edits.

**What gets created:**

* A Pub/Sub topic and a pull subscription in a logging project you choose
* A Cloud Logging sink bound directly to the Billing Account
* The `roles/pubsub.publisher` binding for the sink's writer identity — **the step that is skipped most often, and the number-one cause of a healthy-looking sink that delivers nothing**
* A service account for Abstract with `roles/pubsub.subscriber` on the subscription only

## Sign in first

Cloud Shell opened this repository in a **temporary** session: Google gives repositories it does not own none of your credentials, and deletes the session's files when it ends.

Sign in, then give Terraform the same sign-in:

```bash
gcloud auth login
gcloud auth application-default login
```

<walkthrough-info-message>**Keep the Terraform state outside this session.** Copy `backend.tf.example` to `backend.tf` and set its bucket before `terraform apply`, or the state is deleted when the session ends.</walkthrough-info-message>

## Before you start

<walkthrough-project-setup></walkthrough-project-setup>

You need three things. **The first is usually the blocker, and it is rarely technical:**

1. **`roles/logging.configWriter` on the BILLING ACCOUNT.** Organization Administrator (`roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin`) or Project Owner does not grant this. Find your Billing Account Administrator before you go further.
2. `roles/pubsub.admin` on the logging project.
3. Your billing account ID: `gcloud billing accounts list`

<walkthrough-info-message>Use a **dedicated logging or security project**, not a workload project. Pub/Sub publish quota is consumed in the destination project, and a security pipeline living inside a workload project can be read or broken by that workload's owner.</walkthrough-info-message>

## Step 1 — Set your variables

List available billing accounts:

```bash
gcloud billing accounts list
```

Set the billing account ID and destination logging project:

```bash
export BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID=$(gcloud billing accounts list --format='value(name.basename())' --limit=1)
export LOG_PROJECT=<walkthrough-project-id/>
echo "Billing Account: $BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID"
echo "Log project    : $LOG_PROJECT"
```

If `BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID` is empty you do not have access to any billing accounts. Stop here and request access from your billing administrator.

## Step 2 — Check what is already true (Permissions preflight)

Read-only. Nothing changes.

Inspect the IAM policy on the billing account:

```bash
gcloud billing accounts get-iam-policy "$BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID"
```

The check that matters is **`roles/logging.configWriter` on the BILLING ACCOUNT**. It is the blocking prerequisite and is rarely held by whoever owns the project. If you lack this role, a Billing Account Administrator must grant it:

```bash
gcloud billing accounts add-iam-policy-binding "$BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID" \
  --member="user:$(gcloud config get-value account)" \
  --role="roles/logging.configWriter"
```

<walkthrough-info-message>**Verify Logging Project APIs:** Ensure required APIs are enabled in your logging project before applying:</walkthrough-info-message>

```bash
gcloud services enable pubsub.googleapis.com logging.googleapis.com --project="$LOG_PROJECT"
```

## Step 3 — Inspect the configuration and filter

Billing accounts emit `admin_activity` (IAM changes, budget updates, project links) and `system_event` logs. The module automatically routes these categories.

Read the filter before applying: routing is evaluated at write time and there is no backfill.

<walkthrough-info-message>**Routing is evaluated at write time and there is no backfill.**
A filter that was too narrow leaves a permanent hole you cannot fill later. The default configuration routes all Admin Activity and System Events from the billing account.</walkthrough-info-message>

## Step 4 — Deploy

```bash
cat > terraform.tfvars <<EOF
billing_account_id = "$BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID"
log_project        = "$LOG_PROJECT"
EOF
terraform init && terraform plan
```

You are already in `deployments/10-billing-account` — Cloud Shell opened you here.

When the plan looks right, apply the changes:

```bash
terraform apply
```

Inspect output identities:

```bash
terraform output -raw sink_writer_identity
terraform output -raw topic_id
```

## Step 5 — Wait before you verify

<walkthrough-info-message>**A sink is not live the instant Terraform returns.** Routing is
evaluated at WRITE TIME, so events written during the first couple of minutes after the
sink is created are simply never routed — and no later change recovers
them.</walkthrough-info-message>

Measured against a live GCP environment:

| Event written | Result |
|---|---|
| ~30 s after `CreateSink` | **never delivered** |
| ~2 min after | **never delivered** |
| ~3 min after | delivered, ~60 s end to end |

**This is the single most likely reason you conclude a working pipeline is broken.** You apply, immediately check for events, see nothing, and start pulling the deployment apart. Give it **five minutes**, then check for new events.

## Step 6 — Verify, cloud side first

Check the cloud before you check Abstract. Each step isolates one layer, so a failure localizes instead of becoming a debate.

```bash
# 1. The billing sink exists and points to Pub/Sub
gcloud logging sinks describe abstract-billing-audit-sink \
  --billing-account="$BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID" \
  --format="value(name,destination,writerIdentity)"

# 2. The writer identity actually holds publisher on the topic. THE most-skipped
#    step, and the sink reports healthy without it.
gcloud pubsub topics get-iam-policy abstract-billing-audit-logs --project="$LOG_PROJECT"

# 3. GCP tells you about this failure directly — check for sink errors
gcloud logging read 'logName:"logging.googleapis.com%2Fsink_error"' \
  --limit=20 --project="$LOG_PROJECT"
```

### Pull test messages

Check delivery on a probe subscription, never on Abstract's:

```bash
# Never pull from abstract-billing-audit-logs-sub: with --auto-ack that deletes events before Abstract
# reads them, and without it hides them from Abstract for the ack deadline.
# Pull from a throwaway subscription on the same topic instead. Create it BEFORE the
# test event: a new subscription only receives messages published after it exists.
PROBE="abstract-probe-$(date +%s)"
gcloud pubsub subscriptions create "$PROBE" --topic=abstract-billing-audit-logs \
  --project="$LOG_PROJECT" --expiration-period=1d --message-retention-duration=10m
# Billing events are rare: make one on the billing account (for example create and
# delete a budget), then wait.
sleep 120
gcloud pubsub subscriptions pull "$PROBE" --project="$LOG_PROJECT" --limit=5 --auto-ack
gcloud pubsub subscriptions delete "$PROBE" --project="$LOG_PROJECT" --quiet
```

<walkthrough-info-message>GCP has a **first-class health signal for its own main failure mode**. A sink whose writer identity lacks `pubsub.publisher` produces `exports/error_count`, a `sink_error` log entry, **and a daily `[ACTION REQUIRED]` email**.</walkthrough-info-message>

## Step 7 — Connect Abstract

Retrieve the onboarding output:

```bash
terraform output abstract_onboarding
```

You need two values, plus a key:

* **Project ID** — the project holding the **subscription** (`$LOG_PROJECT`), not the billing account.
* **Subscription ID** — `abstract-billing-audit-logs-sub`.
* **Service-account key** — create it, upload it to Abstract, then delete the local copy:

```bash
export SA_EMAIL=$(terraform output -raw service_account_email)
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create key.json \
  --iam-account="$SA_EMAIL" \
  --project="$LOG_PROJECT"
```

## Done

Your Cloud Billing Account now exports audit logs to Abstract Security via Pub/Sub.
