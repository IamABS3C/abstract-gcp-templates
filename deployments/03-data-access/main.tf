# Data Access audit logs — SEPARATE STATE ON PURPOSE.
#
# Kept apart from the log-export pipeline for two independent reasons, either
# sufficient on its own:
#
#   1. A `terraform destroy` of the collector must never be able to strip an
#      organization's Data Access audit logging. Separate state makes that
#      impossible rather than merely unlikely.
#
#   2. google_*_iam_audit_config is AUTHORITATIVE for the services it names and
#      will fight anything else managing that IAM policy — an ALZ-style org
#      policy pipeline, for instance. Isolated state makes the conflict
#      visible instead of intermittent.
#
# Admin Activity is ALWAYS ON and cannot be disabled. Nothing here enables it,
# and nothing here can turn it off. Only Data Access is off by default.
