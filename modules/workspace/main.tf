# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Google Workspace / Cloud Identity audit logs.
#
# THIS IS A DIFFERENT PIPELINE. Workspace audit data comes from the Admin SDK
# **Reports API**, not Cloud Logging — so no sink, no topic, no filter, at any
# scope, will ever collect it. It is a separate Abstract integration
# (default.google_workspace, PULL) with its own auth model.
#
# The trap this exists to close: a customer asking for "GCP identity logs"
# usually means Workspace sign-ins. GCP console and gcloud logins DO appear in
# admin_activity; Workspace user auth does not. Get that settled on the first
# call, or you deliver a perfect Pub/Sub pipeline that still cannot say who
# logged in.
#
# What Terraform can and cannot do here:
#   CAN  create the service account, enable the API, and emit the exact
#        client ID + scopes + Abstract field values you need
#   CANNOT grant domain-wide delegation. That is a Workspace SUPER ADMIN
#        action in admin.google.com, and there is no API or provider for it.
#        The outputs below give the operator the precise values to paste.
