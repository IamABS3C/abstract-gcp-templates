# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The log-source catalog.
#
# Every collectable GCP surface, as a named category with its exact filter
# clause and a volume tier. You pick categories by INTENT; the module composes
# the filter string.
#
# Why a catalog and not a free-text filter list: a hand-written Cloud Logging
# filter fails SILENTLY. A typo in a logName matches nothing, returns no error,
# and is indistinguishable from a broken sink — which costs days. Here a name
# that is not in the catalog fails at PLAN time with the valid list printed.
#
# Volume tiers are relative, not absolute. Measure before you quote.
#   low       collect always — small and high signal
#   medium    collect always — worth its cost
#   high      collect with intent — real money on a large estate
#   extreme   opt in deliberately; these can dominate the entire bill
