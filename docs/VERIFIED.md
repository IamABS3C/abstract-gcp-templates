# What has actually been proven, and what has not

This repo uses provenance tiers rather than a blanket claim, because "it validates" and
"it deploys" are different things and blurring them is how customers get surprised.

**Last live run: 2026-08-26, against a real GCP organization.**

---

## 🟢 Deployed — executed against a live organization

| | Evidence |
|---|---|
| `deployments/02-audit-logs-organization` **applies cleanly** | `Plan: 9 to add` → applied, no errors |
| Aggregated sink at org scope | `includeChildren=True`, destination is the topic |
| Writer identity granted publisher | `roles/pubsub.publisher: service-org-<ORG>@gcp-sa-logging` |
| Subscription config | 60 s ack, `604800s` (7-day) retention, expiration never |
| No sink errors | `logging.googleapis.com/sink_error` empty throughout |
| **Audit events delivered end to end** | 3 messages pulled, with `methodName`, `principalEmail`, `resourceName`, `callerIp` |
| `scripts/preflight.sh` | Run against the live org; found a real blocker and was verified against the org IAM policy independently |
| **Works with billing DISABLED** | The whole path deployed and delivered on a project with `billingEnabled=False` |
| `deployments/03-data-access` **applies** | 3 scoped services enabled at org scope; preflight reads them back |
| The **authoritative-overwrite guard** fires against real state | With 3 configs present, `allServices` is refused |
| `prevent_destroy` **actually refuses** | `terraform destroy` rejected on sink and subscription; everything survived |
| `deployments/05-health-alerts` **applies** | 3 alert policies created, enabled, wired to a channel, documentation attached |
| The stall alert's **filter matches live data** | Policy filter returned 1 series at **9,391 s** against a 3,600 s threshold |

## 🟡 Validated — compiler and linters, never executed

Everything else. 20 modules and roots pass `tofu validate` at the declared provider floor
and at latest; `tflint` (Google ruleset), `trivy config` and `shellcheck` are clean; 24
guard tests pass with positive controls.

That proves structure. It does not prove runtime.

| Not yet executed | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| `04-workspace` | Domain-wide delegation is a Workspace super-admin action; untested end to end |
| `06-scc-findings` | Needs SCC Premium/Enterprise |
| `09-log-archive`, `08-bucket-logs`, `07-asset-inventory` | Not applied |
| **Infrastructure Manager path** | Blocked — see below |

## 🔴 Blocked — could not be tested, and the reason is useful

### Infrastructure Manager requires billing

`gcloud services enable config.googleapis.com cloudbuild.googleapis.com` returned:

```
reason: UREQ_PROJECT_BILLING_NOT_OPEN
```

Neither API enabled. Infra Manager runs Terraform on **Cloud Build**, and Cloud Build
requires an open billing account. The test organization has a billing account in `open:
False` state across all five projects, so the Infra Manager path could not be exercised at
all.

**This is a genuinely useful finding rather than just a gap.** It means:

| | Needs billing |
|---|---|
| Cloud Shell button / local Terraform | **No** — proven working without it |
| Infrastructure Manager | **Yes** |

So for a sandbox, a trial, or an unfunded project, recommend Cloud Shell. See
[DEPLOY-INFRA-MANAGER.md](DEPLOY-INFRA-MANAGER.md).

## Behaviours found only by running it

Neither of these is in Google's documentation in a form you would find before hitting them.

### Data Access needs TWO switches, and one alone does nothing

Enabling Data Access in the IAM audit config makes the log **generated**. It does not make
it **routed** — the sink filter must also include it.

Verified: after enabling Data Access on three services, the deployed sink's filter
contained no `data_access` clause, so those logs were generated (and billed) and reached
nothing. Flip only the filter instead and it matches **nothing, with no error**.

Keep the service lists identical on both sides.

### The stall alert fires before Abstract is connected — correctly

Nothing consumes the subscription until Abstract is wired up, so
`oldest_unacked_message_age` climbs. Measured **9,391 seconds** within hours of standing the
pipeline up, against a 3,600 s threshold.

That is the alert working, not a false positive. Connect Abstract in the same session, or
expect it.

### `gcloud beta` may not be installed

`gcloud beta monitoring channels create` prompts to install the beta component, which fails
outright in a non-interactive shell — including CI and some Cloud Shell configurations. The
Monitoring REST API needs no component and is in the tutorial as the fallback.

### A sink is not live when Terraform returns

| Event written | Delivered? |
|---|---|
| ~30 s after `CreateSink` | **No — never** |
| ~2 min after | **No — never** |
| ~3 min after | Yes, ~60 s end to end |

Routing is evaluated at **write time**, so events during the propagation window were never
routed and cannot be recovered. **This is the most likely reason someone concludes a
working pipeline is broken** — they apply, test immediately, see nothing, and start pulling
it apart.

Wait five minutes, then fire a **fresh** event.

### `pull` without `--auto-ack` makes the next pull look empty

The first pull delivers but does not acknowledge, so the message sits inside the 60-second
ack deadline and a second pull returns nothing. That reads as "it stopped working."

Always `--auto-ack` when testing by hand.

---

## Bugs the live run found that no amount of local validation would have

All three were in `scripts/preflight.sh`, all fixed.

1. **`gcloud config get-value account` is unset under token auth** — reported "not
   authenticated" while fully authenticated. Cloud Shell service accounts behave the same
   way, so this would have hit customers.
2. **The org-role check was a Python `SyntaxError`** whose output was swallowed, so the
   *"you do NOT hold `logging.configWriter`"* branch fired **unconditionally**. A false
   blocker that would have stopped valid deployments.
3. **GCP's built-in `_Required`/`_Default` sinks were counted as existing exports**, warning
   about duplication that was not there — noise that teaches people to ignore the check.

## Proven 2026-08-27: Abstract pulls from the subscription

The largest gap on this list is now closed. An Abstract configuration was created against
a live tenant and **pulled real events from the org sink's Pub/Sub subscription**.

| Measure | Result |
|---|---|
| Events collected | **90** |
| Bytes ingested | **205,537** |
| Audit events generated to drive it | 63, across 5 services |
| Integration | `default.google_cloud_pub_sub.0_0_11` |

**`pubsub.subscriptions.get` is settled:** `roles/pubsub.subscriber` alone is sufficient.
No additional grant was needed.

**The credential field shape.** `credentials` is a file-type field. It takes a nested
object — not a raw string, not base64, and not a parsed object:

```json
"credentials": { "content": "<the service-account JSON, as a string>", "name": "key.json" }
```

**Always call `/validate` before `create`.** `POST /v2/configurations/validate` reports
precisely which field is wrong, so you can correct the payload before creating anything.

### Confirming events landed, and which query surface to use

Both integrations parse into ACS correctly. Confirmed by retrieving actual documents.

**GCP Audit Logs** — 25 populated fields:

```
vendor          GCP                                     <-- not "google"
product         GCP Audit Logs
action          google.iam.admin.v1.CreateServiceAccountKey
user_name       admin@example.com
user_id         user:admin@example.com
source_address  203.0.113.10
@timestamp      2026-08-27T06:57:38.878Z
```

**Google Workspace** — 18 populated fields:

```
vendor          Google
product         Google Workspace Logs
action          AUTHORIZE_API_CLIENT_ACCESS
event           {category: configuration, code: DOMAIN_SETTINGS...}
cloud           {provider: Google}
organization    {id: C01abcdef}
data_stream     {dataset: Google Workspace Audit Logs (...)}
user_name       admin@example.com
source_ipv4     203.0.113.10
```

**Use `POST /v2/streamviewer/raw-search` with `query_string` to confirm events landed.**
It is the surface that returns whole documents, which is what you want when verifying a
new deployment:

| Surface | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `POST /v2/streamviewer/raw-search` + `query_string` | **Correct.** The only surface that returned the documents |
| `POST /v1/streamviewer/field-analytics` | Returns the **top values** per field. A low-volume new source will not appear beside a high-volume existing one — use raw-search instead when verifying |

**Three things to know about `raw-search`:**

1. **Fields come back nested, not flat.** `event.category` as a top-level key is `null`;
   the value lives in `event: {category: ...}`. A flat-key check reports a populated
   document as empty.
2. **Leading wildcards are rejected**, not ignored:
   `query_string contains a leading-wildcard or regex token ('product:*workspace*');
   not allowed (full-scan risk)`. Trailing wildcards (`vendor:google*`) are fine.
3. **`vendor` is `GCP`, not `google`.** A query of `vendor:google AND NOT
   product:"Google Workspace Logs"` returns **0** and looks like a parse failure. It is a
   wrong-value query. Confirm the actual `vendor` string before concluding absence.

> When verifying a brand-new source, a free-text search for your project ID is the
> quickest way to confirm documents arrived.


## Audit-log generation: what actually produces an event

Established by direct probe, not inference. This governs any attempt to generate test
telemetry.

| Call outcome | Audit entry written? |
|---|---|
| Succeeds | **Yes** |
| Reaches the service and fails on billing (`FAILED_PRECONDITION`) | **Yes** — proven via `cloudkms.CreateKeyRing`, `logging.CreateSink` |
| Reaches the service and fails on permission (`PERMISSION_DENIED`) | **Yes** |
| Rejected because the API is not enabled (`SERVICE_DISABLED`) | **No** — nothing is logged |
| Denied against a resource in another organization | **No** — logged in *that* org, not yours |

**The practical rule: enabling an API is the unlock.** Once enabled, a call audits even
when it fails. But an API that *requires billing to enable* cannot be enabled at all —
`compute`, `dns`, `container` and `secretmanager` all reject enablement with
`FAILED_PRECONDITION: Billing account...`.

### Four log types cannot exist without running VMs

Not a bug, and not a filter error. If these come back empty, this is why:

- **VPC Flow Logs** — requires VMs generating traffic
- **Firewall hit logs** (`compute.googleapis.com/firewall`) — requires a rule with
  `--enable-logging` *and traffic hitting it*
- **DNS query logs** (`dns.googleapis.com/dns_queries`) — requires a DNS policy *and*
  resolvers issuing queries
- **GKE control plane** — requires a cluster

The catalog clauses for these are correct. They will simply never fire in an environment
with no compute.

## Workspace: verified 2026-08-27

- **The Reports API exposes 41 `applicationName` streams**, not the 23 an earlier revision
  of `WORKSPACE.md` claimed. Source of truth is the discovery document:
  `curl -s 'https://admin.googleapis.com/$discovery/rest?version=reports_v1'`
- **Scopes do not overlap with GCP.** A token carrying
  `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform` gets **403 insufficient authentication
  scopes** on both the Reports API and Alert Center. Reports needs
  `admin.reports.audit.readonly`; Alert Center needs `apps.alerts`. This is why Workspace
  **must** be a separate integration — its data never transits Cloud Logging or Pub/Sub
- **Directory API is the exception** — it returned **200** under `cloud-platform`
- **Alert Center** exposes 7 methods: `list`, `get`, `getMetadata`, `batchDelete`,
  `batchUndelete`, `delete`, `undelete`
- **A service account's `oauth2ClientId` equals its `uniqueId`** — that is the value
  Workspace domain-wide delegation asks for
- **Three parameters** configure it: `admin_email`, `credentials`, `application_name`
- **Domain-wide delegation has no API.** It is configured only in the Workspace Admin
  console, at **admin.google.com → Security → Access and data control → API controls →
  Domain-wide delegation**. Plan for a manual step by a Workspace super admin

## To raise the tier further

One apply each, in a project with billing:

2. **Infrastructure Manager** against `02-audit-logs-organization`, in any billed project
3. **One deployment through a GCS backend**, so the documented practice has been done once
4. `04-workspace`, which additionally needs a Workspace super admin
